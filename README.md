# Linked-lists-implementation
This README contains C++ implementations of the following linked list types below 
	1 Singly Linked List
	2 Doubly Linked List
3	Circular Singly Linked List
4	Circular Doubly Linked List
Each linked list type is implemented in a separate file.
	# Compilation
To compile the programs, you will need a C++ compiler (e.g., Dev C++, Visual Studio and etc.). Below is how to compile each file using Dev C++ / Visual Studio 
1. Open a Compiler Application.
2. Navigate to the directory, where you have saved the files.
3. When you run each program, it will display a menu with options for performing various operations on the linked list. Follow the steps to interact with the program.
i.	. Insert at beginning: Insert a new node at the beginning of the list.
ii.	Insert at end: Insert a new node at the end of the list.
iii.	Insert at position: Insert a new node at a specific position in the list.
iv.	Delete from beginning: Deletes the first node from the list.
v.	Delete from end: Deletes the last node from the list.
vi.	Delete from position: Deletes a node from a specific position in the list.
vii.	Display list: Prints the contents of the list to the console.
viii.	Exit: Quits the program.
